            <h3>What we do</h3>
            <p class="content1-text">
              We are an art company who souly and whole-heatedly makes stick-men
              animations in Microsoft Paint. We have made content for many
              movies shows and content creators youve never heard of and will
              probobly never hear of anyway. Our content is of the lowest tier
              of art for the heighest of pricess, the only people that can
              afford our services probably bought our services as a meme because
              they have nothing better to do with their unending wealth.

            <h3>Why we do it</h3>
            <p class="content1-text">
              We are very proud of our profession and we have several of our
              toddler years perfecting it, you wont find any toddler in a mile
              radius who is better at what we do. Because of this (and because I
              sold my soul to the devil and cannot escape) we feel like we are
              required to bring our services where it would otherwise not be
              wanted.

            Hi, im "soul deprived person" and im the head of animation here at
            Stickmen Inc. My job is to make sure that all the content created by
            our team of mindless drone people are down to our standards. Im only
            writing this because they'll give me a bathroom break.

            here, I occasionally get to send people to the dungeons so thats
            pretty cool. My favourite place though, is the brain-washing wing,
            becuase its cool because they make you watch a bunch of 90's
            cartoons.
